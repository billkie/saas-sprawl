# Quacco Product Roadmap

A living document outlining the development phases, goals, and key milestones for **Quacco**, our SaaS subscription tracking and cost-optimization platform. Built on **Next.js** to leverage its latest performance and app-routing features, Quacco aims to help businesses identify, manage, and reduce unnecessary software spending.

---

## Vision

Quacco will serve as the all-in-one “personal finance manager” for business SaaS subscriptions. By automatically detecting subscriptions, providing usage insights, and offering actionable recommendations, we empower organizations (particularly SMBs and mid-market) to cut waste and improve security. Over time, Quacco will evolve to deliver deeper analytics and integrations, becoming an essential cost-optimization partner.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Simplicity**  
   - Make setup quick and easy; avoid complex configurations.  
   - Utilize Next.js features like file-based routing for a clean, intuitive UI.  

2. **Automation First**  
   - Leverage APIs (QuickBooks, Stripe, Google Workspace, etc.) to gather subscription data with minimal manual input.  
   - Automate recurring tasks such as renewal reminders and usage checks.  

3. **Data Security**  
   - Implement modern authentication strategies (e.g., **NextAuth.js**) and strict permission controls.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.  

4. **Actionable Insights**  
   - Go beyond mere subscription listings—provide seat utilization info, redundancy detection, and ROI estimates.  
   - Deliver timely alerts when cost-saving opportunities are detected.

## Product Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: **MVP – Foundational Features**

**Target Completion:** Q2 2025

1. **Basic Subscription Detection**  
   - **Email Scanning**: Parse incoming invoices and payment confirmations from a connected email address (via secure IMAP/SMTP integration).  
   - **Finance Integration**: Connect to QuickBooks or Xero to pull expense data for known SaaS vendors.  
   - **Manual Entry**: Allow users to manually add subscriptions and basic details (vendor name, cost, renewal date).  

2. **Core Dashboard**  
   - **High-Level Spend Overview**: Show total monthly/annual SaaS spend.  
   - **Subscription Listing**: List all detected subscriptions with cost, next renewal date.  
   - **Renewal Reminders**: Automatically send email notifications or Slack alerts (basic Slack webhook integration) 30 days before renewal.  

3. **User Accounts & Authentication**  
   - **Next.js App Router**: Use Next.js 13+ (App Router) for pages and layout organization.  
   - **NextAuth.js**: Implement secure user login and role-based permissions (Admin vs. Contributor).  
   - **Team Collaboration**: Allow multiple team members to access the same company account.  

4. **Hosting & Deployment**  
   - **Vercel Deployment**: Deploy Quacco’s Next.js app to Vercel for speed, scalability, and seamless CI/CD.  
   - **Database**: Use a managed PostgreSQL (e.g., on Supabase or RDS) to store subscription data and user info.  

#### Success Criteria (MVP)
- Ability to import and list at least 80% of a customer’s SaaS subscriptions via email + accounting data.  
- Simple, intuitive UI that users can navigate without training.  
- Renewals are automatically flagged, with at least one successful alert to end-users in real usage.

### Phase 2: **Usage Tracking & Recommendations**

**Target Completion:** Q3 2025

1. **Deep Integrations & Usage Metrics**  
   - **Google Workspace**: Identify active vs. inactive accounts in tools like Google Drive, Meet, etc.  
   - **Slack & Microsoft Teams**: Track user activity to highlight seats that are never used.  
   - **API Connectors**: Provide standard connectors for popular SaaS (e.g., Zoom, HubSpot, Asana) to pull usage stats.  

2. **Duplicate Subscription Detection**  
   - **Same-Category Apps**: Recognize overlapping tools (e.g., both Canva and Adobe subscriptions) and prompt consolidation.  

3. **Advanced Dashboard & Reporting**  
   - **Utilization Reports**: Show seat usage and cost-per-user metrics.  
   - **Savings Suggestions**: Automated suggestions for canceling or downgrading unused subscriptions.  
   - **Data Visualization**: Use charts and graphs (e.g., with [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) or [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)) to present usage vs. cost trends.  

4. **Improved Renewal Workflow**  
   - **One-Click Renewal Confirmation**: Let admins confirm if they want to keep or cancel an upcoming renewal.  
   - **Renewal Calendar View**: Month-by-month snapshot of upcoming renewals.  

#### Success Criteria
- Ability to connect to at least 5 popular SaaS tools for usage stats.  
- Automated detection of redundant apps for a pilot set of customers.

### Phase 3: **Automated Cancellation & Governance**

**Target Completion:** Q4 2025

1. **Centralized Cancellation Actions**  
   - **Automated Workflows**: For selected vendors, Quacco can initiate cancellation or plan downgrade via vendor APIs (where available).  
   - **In-App Communication**: Generate email templates or direct requests to vendor support to simplify manual cancellations.  

2. **Budget & Governance Features**  
   - **Role-Based Approvals**: Larger teams may require manager or finance approvals for new subscriptions or cancellations.  
   - **Spending Limits & Alerts**: Set monthly or quarterly SaaS spending thresholds; trigger alerts if nearing the limit.  

3. **Audit & Compliance**  
   - **Change Logs**: Track who added, modified, or canceled a subscription, with timestamped records.  
   - **Security & Access Reviews**: Provide a periodic security review indicating which users still have access to sensitive SaaS.  

4. **Team Onboarding & Offboarding**  
   - **Employee Lifecycle Management**: Identify subscriptions that need to be provisioned or revoked when a user joins or leaves the company.  

#### Success Criteria
- Demonstrable reduction in the time it takes for businesses to cancel or modify subscriptions (compared to manual processes).  
- Adoption by finance teams who require more formal budget oversight.  
- At least 50% of user base utilizing the in-app cancellation features for at least one SaaS vendor.

### Phase 4: **Intelligent Insights & AI-Driven Optimization**

**Target Completion:** Q1 2026

1. **AI-Based Usage Forecasting**  
   - Use historical usage patterns to predict future seat requirements, preventing over-provisioning.  
   - Suggest potential alternative tools based on user preferences and cost constraints (e.g., “Consider switching from App A to App B at 30% lower cost, similar feature set”).  

2. **Cost Benchmarking**  
   - Compare your company’s subscription spend (by category) against industry peers or aggregated benchmarks.  
   - Highlight if you’re overpaying relative to market averages.  

3. **Multi-Currency & Global Support**

#### Success Criteria
- Measurable improvements in cost forecasting accuracy for pilot customers.
